BCA Research Hub is a virtual database for BCTS high school research students.

Installation is pretty straightforward, as long all files are pulled correctly you just need to have NodeJS properly installed and run 
**npm install** in the terminal and all of the correct Node packages will be installed into the project.

One of these packages is Nodemon, which runs the server at all times during development. To start this up, run **nodemon app.js** in the terminal.

The project is also deployed on Railway at https://bca-research-hub.up.railway.app/, and it is synced with this repository.
